# Transfer-Learning-for-Image-Classification
In this project, we build a classifier that distinguishes images of 20 bird species. When dealing with classification of relatively small image datasets, deep networks may not perform very well because of not having enough data to train them. In such cases, one usually uses transfer learning.
